Important Note:

* Scene Objects: If the object is part of the scene (saved with the scene file), it'll be batter to manually assign a Unique ID. This ID will be used to match and restore saved data when loading the game, but carefull not setting the same id on multiple objects!
i recommend you to generate an id by the Context (Righ click on the script component -> Generate ID)

* Runtime/Spawned Objects: If the object is instantiated during gameplay, leave the Unique ID field empty. The script will automatically generate a new one for you.

* Prefab Name: Leave the Prefab name field empty if you donâ€™t want this object to respawn automatically on load (if it's missing in the current scene), otherwise make sure to check this steps:

	1. The prefab is inside 'Resources' folder
	2. The prefab has the ISaveable component
	3. Prefab Name Field must be the same prefab name in the resources folder

The save file is stored at: Application.dataPath / SceneName / WorldName.json
